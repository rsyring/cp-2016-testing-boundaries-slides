Summary
-------

When it comes to automated tests, testing our internal code is often the easiest. But when it comes
to things like Databases, Email, Web APIs, that is, when we cross our application's outer
"boundary", testing can get really difficult really fast. In this talk, we will look at best
practices for automated testing around areas of our application that reach beyond it's "boundary."
